# Description of my submission to [AutoPET III](https://autopet-iii.grand-challenge.org/) challenge. 

## Weights 
The segmentation algorithm is simply based on [nnUNet-v2](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet). Here you can download the [pre-trained weights](https://1drv.ms/u/s!AvHWEJ75IkwYgkhAG10Qo3pWGoS8?e=SvZnuO). 
One would need to follow the instructions of [nnUNet-v2](https://github.com/MIC-DKFZ/nnUNet) for inference on your own data. 

Feel free to shot me an email if you have any questions.
